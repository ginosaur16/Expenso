Hello!

My Name is **Giulliano Suarez**, a *Computer Engineer* graduate from Mapùa University.
This is the first project I made for my Github portfolio and its purpose is to show my programming and logic skills with my created app.

The name of the app is **Expenso**. An expense tracker developed for iOS using Xcode with SwiftUI.

Why an **Expense Tracker**?
- I primarily thought of developing one as I am keen on keeping personal financial stability in my life and also want others to try to keep track with their expenses given how much of the economy has changed over the years. Hopefully some people see the importance of this and do the same to achieve financial stability.

The repository will serve as my development process for this app.
